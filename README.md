Sure! Here's a **detailed brief** for your Number Recognition project using Deep Learning with FastAPI and TensorFlow datasets:

## üìò Project Brief: Number Recognition using Deep Learning and FastAPI

This project is a deep learning-based number recognition system designed to classify handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the popular **MNIST dataset** provided by TensorFlow. Once trained, the model is served through a lightweight and high-performance **FastAPI** application that exposes an HTTP endpoint for making predictions on digit images.

### üí° Objective

The goal is to create an API service that:

* Accepts input images (of handwritten digits)
* Preprocesses and feeds them into a trained deep learning model
* Returns the predicted digit along with the confidence score

This allows the model to be consumed easily by frontend apps, other backend services, or even mobile devices through RESTful HTTP requests.

### üß† Model Training

* The project uses the **MNIST** dataset from TensorFlow, which contains 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels).
* A simple but effective **CNN** architecture is used to achieve high accuracy on the dataset.
* After training, the model is saved (`.h5` format) and loaded by the API for inference.

### üöÄ FastAPI Integration

* The trained model is wrapped in a **FastAPI** app, which provides:

  * A `/predict` endpoint for submitting digit images
  * Swagger UI documentation for interactive testing
  * JSON-based responses with predicted class and confidence

### üì¶ Key Components

* **TensorFlow/Keras**: Model training and inference
* **FastAPI**: API creation and deployment
* **Pillow**: Image processing (resizing, grayscaling, etc.)
* **NumPy**: Numerical operations on image data
* **Uvicorn**: ASGI server to run the FastAPI app

### üß™ Example Use Case

A user sends a POST request with a digit image to the API. The API processes the image, feeds it into the CNN model, and responds with:

```json
{
  "prediction": 5,
  "confidence": 0.997
}
```

### üîç Use Cases

* Educational demos on deep learning and APIs
* Backend service for digit recognition apps
* Prototypes for mobile OCR tools

### üìà Future Enhancements

* Support for other datasets (e.g., EMNIST, custom digits)
* Model optimization with TensorFlow Lite
* Dockerization and deployment to cloud (e.g., Heroku, AWS)
